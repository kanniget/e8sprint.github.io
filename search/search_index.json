Application control is implemented on all servers to restrict the execution of executables to an approved set. Maturity Level Two \u00b6 Application control is implemented on all workstations to restrict the execution of executables, software libraries,scripts and installers to an approved set. Application control is implemented on all servers to restrict the execution of executables, software libraries, scripts and installers to an approved set. Maturity Level Three \u00b6 Application control is implemented on all workstations to restrict the execution of executables, software libraries, scripts and installers to an approved set. Application control is implemented on all servers to restrict the execution of executables, software libraries, scripts and installers to an approved set. Microsoft\u2019s latest recommended block rules are implemented to prevent application control bypasses. Implementation Guidance \u00b6 The following examples are not application control: Simply preventing a user from installing new applications to their computer\u2019s hard disk. Using a \u2018next-generation\u2019 firewall in an attempt to identify whether network traffic is generated by an approved application. Using \u2018next-generation\u2019 cyber security software, or any other vendor product, that decides whether an application should be allowed to execute based on factors other than the system administrator\u2019s pre-configured list of approved applications. The ability of application control to provide a reasonable barrier for low to moderately sophisticated cyber security incidents depends on the solution chosen to implement application control, combined with its configuration settings, as well as the file permissions controlling which directories a user (and therefore malware) can write to and execute from. Ensure that application control prevents unapproved programs running regardless of their file extension. A very basic implementation to mitigate some unsophisticated malware from running involves using application control or filesystem permissions to block execution from user profile directories. Such directories include %AppData%, %LocalAppData%, their subdirectories, as well as %TEMP%. Additionally, to prevent malicious scripts from running when clicked on by users, the notepad program can be associated with script file extensions such as .hta, .js, .jse, .vbs, .vbe, .wsf and .ps1. Organisations that don\u2019t require the use of Windows Script Host are strongly advised to disable it, while other organisations should use application control to allow only approved scripts to run. After performing testing to confirm that there is no significant business impact, deny typical low-privileged users the ability to run all script execution engines shipped with Microsoft Windows including Windows Script Host (cscript.exe and wscript.exe which run JScript and VBScript including Windows Script Files), powershell.exe, powershell_ise.exe, cmd.exe, wmic.exe and where possible Microsoft HTML Application Host (mshta.exe). The ACSC urges organisations to exercise caution when using publisher certificate rules to allow operating system files and other applications to execute. There is a security risk of inadvertently allowing applications that are digitally signed by the same publisher which can be used for legitimate purposes or malicious purposes such as network propagation and running malicious programs. To help mitigate this security risk, ensure that publisher certificate rules specify the \u2018Product Name\u2019 in addition to the \u2018Publisher Name\u2019. Where possible, prevent users (and therefore malware running on the user\u2019s behalf) from running system executables commonly used for malicious purposes as listed in mitigation strategy \u2018Continuous incident detection and response\u2019. Note the exception for regsvr32.exe and rundll32.exe \u2013 these are required for legitimate functionality but can be abused to circumvent application control, which can be mitigated by configuring rules in Microsoft\u2019s Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET). It is advisable to deploy application control in phases, instead of trying to deploy it to an entire organisation at once. For example, after fully testing and understanding application control to avoid false positives, one approach is to deploy application control to the computers used by senior executives and their executive assistants. Such users are Most Likely Targets who usually run a limited number of software applications such as Microsoft Office, an email program and a web browser. An additional benefit is that, when these users are made aware that they clicked on a malicious email attachment or visited a malicious website and application control mitigated the compromise, they might provide additional support for the deployment of application control to more computers in the organisation. Deploying application control is easier if the organisation has detailed visibility of what software is installed on computers. Such visibility can be obtained by using a Standard Operating Environment, maintaining an inventory of software installed and implementing a robust change management process. Initially testing application control in \u2018audit\u2019/\u2019logging only\u2019 mode helps organisations to develop an inventory of installed software, while taking care to avoid including existing malware in the inventory. Once an inventory has been established, application control can be properly configured in \u2018enforce\u2019 mode to prevent unapproved programs from running. When installing new software, avoid creating hashes for added files that aren\u2019t of an executable nature. Otherwise if every new file is hashed, the list of hashes is likely to become too large and if distributed via Group Policy, might unacceptably slow down users logging into their computers. Additionally, note that installing new software can create subdirectories in allowed paths that provide users (and therefore malware) with write and execute permissions, enabling arbitrary unapproved or malicious programs to run. Organisations need to verify the effectiveness of application control periodically and especially after installing new software.
