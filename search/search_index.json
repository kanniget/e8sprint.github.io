Application control is implemented on all servers to restrict the execution of executables to an approved set. Maturity Level Two Application control is implemented on all workstations to restrict the execution of executables, software libraries,scripts and installers to an approved set. Application control is implemented on all servers to restrict the execution of executables, software libraries, scripts and installers to an approved set. Maturity Level Three Application control is implemented on all workstations to restrict the execution of executables, software libraries, scripts and installers to an approved set. Application control is implemented on all servers to restrict the execution of executables, software libraries, scripts and installers to an approved set. Microsoft\u2019s latest recommended block rules are implemented to prevent application control bypasses. Implementation Guidance The following examples are not application control: Simply preventing a user from installing new applications to their computer\u2019s hard disk. Using a \u2018next-generation\u2019 firewall in an attempt to identify whether network traffic is generated by an approved application. Using \u2018next-generation\u2019 cyber security software, or any other vendor product, that decides whether an application should be allowed to execute based on factors other than the system administrator\u2019s pre-configured list of approved applications. There are a number of potential solutions that can be used to provide adequate application control. The effectiveness of each solution depends on its capabilities and the chosen settings. While the effectiveness of a solution really depends on how well it prevents uncontrolled execution of programs, To be really effective the solution should meet the following criteria: It can prevent execution of applications regardless of file extension. It can prevent execution of programs based on signatures or hashes. It can prevent execution of programs based on file system location. It can use combinations of all of the above in some form. An example a simple solution would be to: Using filesystem permissions to prevent execution from within user profile directories, including %AppData%, %LocalAppData%, %TEMP% and all their subdirectories. create filesystem extension associatins to map script files to notepad, and as a result prevent direct execution of the script. This example would give basic protection but in itself does not completely meet maturity level 1. Other suggestions: - Disable Windows Script Host unless its explicitly needed, if it is needed then use more advanced forms of application control to limit execution to known scripts. Disable all scripting engine executions for low privileged users. This includes Windows Scripting Host, powershell, powershell_ise, cmd, wmic and mshta. If this isnt possible limit execution to only those script types determined necessary via testing. Use caution accepting broad publisher certificate rules when creating your policies. There may be legitimate applications that have been signed by that publisher that can be used in a malicious manner and not needed on your systems. Make your publisher based certificate rules as specific as possible by specifying \u2018Product Name\u2019 in the rules. Where possible restrict users access to applications known to be regularly used for malicious purposes. Check out the ACSC Guide on Continuous incident detection and response for examples. Deploy the application control to all groups in the first instance in a Audit/logging only mode, this provides detailed visibility of the applications in use across the organisation and can assist in the development of the enforcement policies to be rolled out later. When developing enforcement policies be careful not to include existing malware in the accepted list of applications. Deploy the enforcement versions of application control policy in an iterative approach. Select target groups based on usage complexity and roll out to each group startting the least complex group first and progressing through all the groups until the most complex group has been covered. This limits the complexity of supporting the process and reduces the potential impact on users of trying to cover all bases in a single rollout. Avoid creating hashes for all files that are part of an application deployment. Not all the files that are installed as part of an application are actually executable and the resulting Policy may prove to be problematic for maintenance and even create performance impacts for the users. Take note of any subdirectories created as part of an installation and make sure execution permissions are restricted to only the application itself and not all the subdirectories as well.
